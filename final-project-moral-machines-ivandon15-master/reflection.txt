Part 1. How to make the decision:
In Human, generally, my basic idea is that we always save those who are more
capable, whether it's because they contribute more to the society(scientists
may solve this ethical problem, doctors at the scene of the accident may give
you first aid and so on) or from an insurance standpoint(their compensation
must be higher than a homeless).
In Animal, hitting a pet means you need to make a claim, so the proportion of
a pet and not a pet is 10:1. (sounds impersonal, but these are all assumptions!)

Part 2. Something surprise
It wasn't designed with the idea that the program had to save the user, but it
gave the user a lot of weight (I thought the survive ratio of user is the highest).
However, after auditing five times 100-run scenarios, the survive ratios of user
are around 0.6. What is more, survival rates under whether it is legal to cross
are similar, contrary to what I first thought, people who cross legally have a
better chance of survival.

Part 3. Consequence
Even if the programmer does a very precise job of assigning weights, with a lot
of data testing, results contrary to the initial idea may occur. This is why the
design of the algorithm is so important. In moral machine, the algorithm must be
polished before it can be used.
